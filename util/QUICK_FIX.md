# Quick Fix Reference - Inhomogeneous Grid Error

## Error You Were Seeing
```
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. 
The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. 
The detected shape was (21,) + inhomogeneous part.
```

## What Was Wrong
Different field directories had DSSF data with different numbers of frequency points (e.g., field_0.0 had 239 points, field_0.1 had 479 points). Numpy couldn't stack these into a single array.

## What Was Fixed
All three scripts now automatically interpolate data to a common frequency grid:
- âœ… `reader_pyrochlore.py` 
- âœ… `animate_DSSF_pyrochlore.py`
- âœ… `create_comparison_plots.py`

## Try It Now
Your original command should now work:

```bash
python animate_DSSF_pyrochlore.py /path/to/your/data
```

Or with the main script:

```bash
python reader_pyrochlore.py /path/to/your/data --animate
```

## What You'll See
If different grid sizes are detected:
```
[animate_DSSF_spinon_photon] Warning: Different frequency grid sizes detected: {239, 479}
[animate_DSSF_spinon_photon] Interpolating all data to common frequency grid...
```

Then it proceeds normally to create your animations!

## No Action Needed
The fix is automatic - just run your command again. ðŸš€
